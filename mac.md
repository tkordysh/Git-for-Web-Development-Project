## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? 
    Git is an open source distributed version control system. 
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
    Git is a version control system, but Github is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, Github helps you better manage them.
3. Why do we create a branch? 
    We create a branch to work on a project element separately before deploying changes to the main code. 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
    A pull request allows a dev to tell others about changes he/she pushed to a branch.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
    One can use the git switch command to switch between branches. 
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
    Git fetch will check the origin repository for any changes or updates that may have been pushed. Git merge is a command that integrates changes from one branch to another while still preserving the branch's history. Git pull will first run git fetch to check for changes, then git merge to integrate those changes. 
7. What is a merge conflict?
    A merge conflict occurs when competing changes are made to the same line of a file. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
    In Github, there is a 'Resolve Conflicts' button if you access a repository's pull requests that allows you to go in and choose which branch's changes to keep.
